# Founder := Oscar

Understand and create technology has been my passion since I was a kid. I grow up playing legos and surrounded by trilling amazing technology wondering how everything works, enjoying stoning video games with a fancy 8-32MB video card seems the way I used to spend my afternoons, captivated by them I thought video games were my passion until the university came, and video game development degree appears to be a great idea, but after a few semesters I figured out my passion was on other areas of software and technology  but I learned a lot there (Software engineer + Computer graphics + Artist concepts) = ðŸ¤¯.

Iâ€™m an ex_machinaâ€¦ in fact, I used to work for a start-up named after it.

Now I am Founding Ebron.tech, a company that solves problems through technology. What does make it different? Ebron was born to develop solutions for real life issues, but also has higher propose focused on the church needs and make the people  (more Info here).

As you imagine I am also Christian, I believe in God I have served at church for my entire life in multiple ministries like Music, Sound, Photo, Video and recently [creating software](https://github.com/ebron-tech/FamilyFeud).
