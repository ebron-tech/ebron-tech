# Founder
Hey you.
My name is Oscar.
Understand and create technology has been my passion since I was a kid. I grow playing legos and surrounded by trilling amazing technology, playing stoning video games with a fancy 8-32MB video card, I thought video games were my passion until I start studying video game development at UNIAT. I figured out my passion was on other areas, but I learned a lot there (ðŸ¤“software engineer + ðŸ’»computer graphics + ðŸŽ¨artist concepts) = ðŸ¤¯.

Iâ€™m an ex_machinaâ€¦ literary used to work for a start-up named after it. There we developed a lot of projects. ( check them clicking here )

Now I am Founding Ebron.tech, a project that solves problems through technology. What does make it different? Ebron was born with a higher propose: create technology for realife issues but also is focused on the church needs (more Info here).

As you imagine I am also Cristian, I believe in God I have served at church for my entire life in multiple ministries like: Music(ðŸŽ¹), Sound, Photo, Video and recently [creating software](/churchres).
